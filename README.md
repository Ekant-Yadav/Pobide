# Pobide


PoBiDe.Ai is a project aimed to address the problem of fake information and bias in news. It uses advanced natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to detect fake news and political bias.

The namesake of PoBiDe comes from the first two letters of every word in "Political Bias Detector". Pair this with artificial intelligence, and you have our name, "PoBiDe.Ai".
